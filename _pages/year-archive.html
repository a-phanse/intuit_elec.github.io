<p> Over the last many years studying electronics - specifically power and analog - I have come across very few resources on the internet which help with building intuition around complex electronics concepts. The resources available on the internet are either overly simplistic - so much so that they are either wrong or they forget to mention important nuances - or the main takeaways get lost in the math. There are of course some honorable exceptions. Textbooks cerntainly convey the information most accurately. However, the fine nuggets of information get lost in the sheer volume of the content that textbooks cover. </p>
<p> Here, I hope, you will find succinct, accurate, and thought-provoking content relevant to power and analog electronics - circuit architectures, devices, and the theoretical tools to build and analyze the same, like control systems and signal processing. You might also come across some other interesting things that I came across and my thoughts about the same. </p>
