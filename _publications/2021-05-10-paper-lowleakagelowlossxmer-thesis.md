Designing transformers for HF applications with low magnetizing inductance is challenging because of increased core and copper losses and losses due to stored energy in the leakage inductance. Many converter topologies and applications cannot absorb the leakage inductance of the transformer, so designs that minimize leakage are very valuable. We propose a transformer structure which has low leakage inductance and low losses making it suitable for applications requiring energy storage transformers or coupled inductors. The transformer structure achieves near zero MMF drop across the window which results in a design with low leakage. It achieves current conduction along most of the skin of the conductors and is also suitable for high turns ratio applications because of its ability to achieve equal current sharing between paralleled turns. Because of these reasons, the transformer achieves low conduction losses without requiring the use of litz wire. Step-by-step design guidelines are proposed to achieve a roughly optimized structure and the design of a transformer with L [subscript mag] =105nH and 1-10 turns ratio for use in a 400W, 20-400V coupled-inductor based boost converter is presented.
